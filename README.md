## Introduction 

This is the repository for the Bear EXtruder and X Axis version 2 (BearExxa V2). It improves Prusa MK2.5(S, S+) and MK3(S, S+) print quality, speed, reliability and serviceability. It's the [BearExxa V1](https://github.com/gregsaun/bear_extruder_and_x_axis) successor.

## Features

  - Compatible with stock Prusa MK2.5(S, S+) and MK3(S, S+) hardware as well as Bear frame
  - High print quality by solving both repetitive and random extrusion artifacts. Read our detailed [Design Goals](extra/design_goals.md) for more details
  - High torque and cold extruder motor for the best reliability and print quality in all conditions
  - Light print head without compromising features
  - Short filament path
  - Built-in filament sensor
  - Very concentric extruder gearing
  - Stiffer X axis
  - Efficient belt tensioning system
  - E3D Revo hotend with quick swap nozzles
  - Support multicolour printing (MMU or ERCF)
  - Quick and easy to service
  - Optimized for high reliability
  - Improved cable management
  - Special attention to safety with CE compliant hardware and careful testing
  - No special tools, no crimping, no soldering and no difficult adjustments required during the assembly
  - Detailed assembly guides and documentation
  - Fully open source

## Disclaimer

This project is only to provide an alternative extruder and X axis to your Prusa printers. We are not related to Prusa Research. We cannot be taken responsible for any damages you may do by using this project nor any decision Prusa would take on you (e.g.: loosing warranty). This project is at your own risk.


## Project Status

Status: Currently building the repository for the Beta release

This project is on hold for now. It's provided "as is" for any adventurous users interested in having a good extruder for their Prusa or Bear. The beta version of the BearExxa V2 provided here is fully functional and safe to use. The end goal is to provide a kit with all the parts and an improved stepper and hardware for better print quality and reliability (read our [Design Goals](extra/design_goals.md)).


## How To

How to print, build and start using the BearExxa V2:

1. Read the [Project Status](#project-status), [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) and [Compatibility](#compatibility) to make sure you agree to the limitations
2. Buy the official BearExxa v2 kit or gather the parts using the [BOM](#bill-of-materials)
3. Buy the filament according to the [Print Settings](#print-settings)
4. [Download](#download) the BearExxa V2 printed parts and documentation
5. Calibrate your filaments with our [Calibration Guide](https://guides.bear-lab.com/Guide/Extrusion+multiplier+and+filament+diameter/8)
6. Slice and print the parts according to the [Print Settings](#print-settings)
7. Follow the [Assembly Guide](#assembly-guide)
8. Enjoy your new extruder :)


## Compatibility

The BearExxa V2 is compatible with both Prusa MK2.5(S, S+) and MK3(S, S+). The original and Bear frames are both supported. The stock firmware can be used except for the initial calibration (self tests) for which we provide our own firmware.
